aMule Remote for Android

This is the source code for the Android application 
[aMule Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iukonline.amule.android.amuleremote).
aMule Remote used to be closed source, but I'm now publishing the code under
GNU GPL License.

aMule Remote needs maintenance in order to be compliant with Android 5.0+
and to support the upcoming 2.3.2 and 2.4 aMule releases. Anyone willing
to work on the needed enhancement please get in touch with me or just
branch the code, as long as you keep the proejct open source and the app free.

aMule Remote started as an Eclipse project but later moved to Android Studio.

The source code published here contains several enhancements, a GUI refactoring,
and some bug fixes, that have never been published on Play Store, due to
lack of time on my side.
